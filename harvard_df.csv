The eye is led into the hermitage via the pathway at the right hand side. As one approaches the soft-focus landscape periodically resolves into crisply descriptive highlights: a round straw hat hanging by the doorway, books and a rosary set within the resident’s studio, a crescent moon-shaped decoration cut into the wood of the shutter at far left, and the russet tips of a smattering of autumnal leaves in the garden. A slim tree trunk speckled with verdigris lichens rises up just right of center in the left screen; its elliptical leathery leaves arch down over the roof of the studio in the top center of the right screen, almost puncturing the fourth wall. The leaves that entreat us to enter are distinctive, identifiable as those of the persimmon and thus a key to the identity of the tranquil location depicted: we have come to the “Rakushisha” 落柿舎 or Hermitage of Fallen Persimmons."

Individual plant forms are defined using a technique known as tarashikomi, in which black ink and/or mineral pigments have been splashed onto areas of still-moist ink wash, resulting in evocative pools of saturation. The evolution of such seemingly effortless and yet technically difficult decorative imagery also found expression in many other media during the Edo period (1615-1868), so that divisions between the various arts--such as painting, lacquerware, and metalwork--began to blur. Tarashikomi is one of the hallmarks of so-called Rimpa-style paintings--works done in emulation of Tawaraya Sōtatsu (died c. 1643), who is credited with having consciously evoked and updated the rich, allusive imagery of Japan's Heian-period (794-1185) past. The artist to whom this painting is attributed, Kitagawa Sōsetsu, appears to have been an accomplished and faithful mid-seventeenth-century follower in the direct line of Sōtatsu; however, many questions remain regarding Sōsetsu's identity and oeuvre. This work is likely one of a set of paintings depicting either the Flowers of the Twelve Months or the Flowers of the Four Seasons."

Each figure stands facing the right in three-quarter view; each is perched atop a pair of lotuses held aloft by clouds that carry the deities in a slight downward direction, from upper left to lower right. Painted predominantly in gold pigment on dyed silk, with just a few touches of ink and color to highlight facial accents on the Buddha and the bodhisattvas' jewels and scarves, the scene illustrates a raigō, or “welcoming descent” scene in which Amitabha descends from his celestial realm in order to receive the soul of a devotee and transport it to the Western Pure Land—a distant paradise believed to provide the ideal conditions for attaining enlightenment. The resplendent but empty lotus seat carried by Avalokitesvara in the lower right of this painting is the vehicle intended to carry the soul of the believer to the Western Pure Land."

The blue-skinned god is surrounded by women that are have snake (naga) half human. The image depicts a scene from the Bhagavata Purana, (History of God). The Bhagvata Purana is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas (Great Histories) and is a revered text in Vaishnavism, a Hindu tradition that worships Vishnu. Produced sometime between the sixth and tenth century, the text promotes bhakti (devotion) to Krishna. When Krishna was a youth, he went into the Yamuna River to rescue his ball. He encountered, Kaliya, a poisonous snake (naga) with 110 hoods. The serpent wrapped his body around Krishna, but the deity expanded his body, causing Kaliya to release him. Then, Krishna assumed the weight of the universe and danced on the naga’s hoods, beating time with his feet. Kaliya’s wives begged Krishna to show mercy for their dying husband, depicted here. The awesomeness of Krishna’s size and strength is denoted through his ease in holding up the fearsome serpent. Although Krishna could have vanquished Kaliya, he showed the creature mercy and pardoned him."

Wearing a dark green jama, Raja Balwant Singh, king of Jasrota, leans forward with a sword in one hand to defend his elephant from an attacking lion. The scene is packed with intense action, all the retainers on foot and on horseback rushing forward to help. The mahaout elephant trainer is poised to push the elephant goad into the head of the lion. The sparse setting gives little clue to the foreground violence: the landscape is bare, dotted with just a few palash trees. The chaotic scene is witnessed by a distant hawk, who circles through the sky above.

Nainsukh was one of the most famous artists working in the Punjab Hills. Balwant Singh comissioned numerous portraits from Nainsukh, ranging from scenes of state audiences and royal hunts to intimate moments in the life of the ruler.

The haloed king is mounted on a caparisoned horse holding a pig-sticking spear.  He wears a green jama, or robe, that is associated with aheria, or the spring hunt, when boars are hunted in Rajasthan. According to Rajasthani tradition, it is believed that the outcome of aheria fortetold the fruitfulness of the kingdom for the year ahead. Bhim Singh's had a successful hunt, alluded to by the several slain wild board strapped to the backs of the camels leading the procession. At the bottom corner of the image are two members of the hunting retinue with Saluki hounds, which were commonly used during boar hunting for stalking, chasing, and, at times, killing. A facloner is also present among the procession. 

The attendants carry the necessary royal attributes: two attendants carry fly whisks while one holds a sun-faced standard, which accompanies any Mewari royal procession. The sun is a symbol of the Mewar royal family who believed that they were descendants of it.

This painting was executed before Bhim Singh became the first maharana of the Princely State of Udaipur.

The eye is led into the hermitage via the pathway at the right hand side. As one approaches the soft-focus landscape periodically resolves into crisply descriptive highlights: a round straw hat hanging by the doorway, books and a rosary set within the resident’s studio, a crescent moon-shaped decoration cut into the wood of the shutter at far left, and the russet tips of a smattering of autumnal leaves in the garden. A slim tree trunk speckled with verdigris lichens rises up just right of center in the left screen; its elliptical leathery leaves arch down over the roof of the studio in the top center of the right screen, almost puncturing the fourth wall. The leaves that entreat us to enter are distinctive, identifiable as those of the persimmon and thus a key to the identity of the tranquil location depicted: we have come to the “Rakushisha” 落柿舎 or Hermitage of Fallen Persimmons."

Skilled at landscape depictions but best known for his representations of oxen, Kim Sik came from a prominent family of painters and was the grandnephew of Kim Che (active 1540), one of sixteenth-century Korea's most famous painters of birds and flowers. The genre of bird-and-flower painting arose in China during the Northern Song period (960-1127) and remained popular through succeeding dynasties; it spread to Korea early in the Chosŏn (1392-1911) dynasty and to Japan in the Muromachi period (1392-1568). Chinese painters tended to depict birds in color, while Korean and Japanese artists preferred to render them in monochrome ink. The hard-edged washes used to portray the birds and blossoming pinks in this leaf attests to Kim Sik's mastery of brush and ink. Native to China, pinks appear only occasionally in Chinese paintings; by contrast, they occur with some frequency in Korean and Japanese works. Gold-flecked paper enjoyed a measure of popularity among Chinese literati artists of the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) periods; it sparked interest among Korean painters of the mid-Chosŏn period and claimed widespread popularity by the nineteenth century. Although they had employed a variety of decorated papers at least since Heian times (794-1185), Japanese artists seldom used this type of lightly flecked paper. Only occasionally used by Chinese painters, tinted papers enjoyed a vogue in Korea throughout the Chosŏn dynasty. Such colored papers seldom were dyed during manufacture; rather, they were tinted with ink washes--generally pale gray or blue--after manufacture but before painting.

He aims his matchlock gun at a group of heron circling in the sky. Behind him, a princess points to the group of birds, while a female attendant holds a fly whisk. On the left side of the composition, another female attendant picks up a slain heron. The figure behind her carries another matchlock gun. She may be a princess herself, as the attendant behind her holds a standard above her head, a symbol of imperial status. The painting may depict a friendly shooting competition between Sujan Singh and the princess. Female royalty also participated in hunting activities, as it was considered a demonstration of their grace, beauty, and intellect.

An imaginary space asserts itself around some of the forms and offers a vaguely organic impression.
Feng Zhongrui, who left China for Taiwan in 1949, was a member of the Fifth Moon Group. Like other members of the group, he developed a modernist style, incorporating elements inspired by Western abstract expressionism into Chinese painting. He achieved spontaneous effects by splashing and applying ink and color with a palm-fiber brush."

The palette suggests autumn, and the brushstrokes suggest rock surfaces eroded into pinnacles and boulders.
Hong Xian used traditional Chinese brushwork in a composition that recalls Western format and picture space. Though not without precedent in Chinese art, the large horizontal format and the vantage point offering a panoramic view most likely have their sources in Western painting.
Hong Xian left China for Taiwan in 1948, and there had the remarkable opportunity to study traditional Chinese painting with Pu Ru (1896–1963), the former Manchu prince, whose work preserved the noble court painting traditions of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). She also studied art at National Taiwan Normal University. In 1958 she came to the U.S., where she studied Western art at Northwestern University and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She thus had training at the highest levels in both traditions."

Ink brushstrokes applied densely and tightly define craggy peaks, rock faces, and trees, the last seeming to grow against all odds from openings in the canyon walls.
Yu Chengyao inscribed the painting, “Deep Ravine, Rushing Torrent. Gigantic rocks pile up on lofty peaks. Spring waters, green as jade, splash across dangerous paths. White clouds hover above the emerald valley. When can I return home?”
“Home” for Yu was mainland China. He served as a general in the Chinese army during the Sino-Japanese War (1937–45) and then moved to Taiwan with the Nationalist government in 1949. With no formal training in the arts, he took up painting in 1954. In technique, his paintings bear little relation to the brushwork of traditional Chinese masters, but in composition they approach the monumentality of the great landscapists of the Northern Song period (960–1127)."

The vivid color washes are rich and wet, accented by fine ink lines. Here the artist has created a personal miniature world in which living creatures exist apart from real time or space. And yet, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the creatures depicted are the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac for the cycle of years from 1984 to 1995. Standing in for the dragon is the appropriate Chinese character, rather than a depiction of the beast. The Chinese calendar dates appear on each page, as do puns or homonyms that refer to auspicious omens suggested by each animal."

Surrounding them are the elements of a classical garden, including lotus ponds, scholars’ pavilions, trees, and rocks. The shapes of the rocks and plants merge with the equally strange shapes of the human figures drawn in childlike fashion. In the “distance” at the top of the painting, a dark and remote landscape looms.
Yu Peng’s childhood interests in puppetry and ink and oil painting led him to develop a style so eccentric that he was denied admission into any fine arts school. His search for his cultural roots took him from his native Taiwan to mainland China, where he visited Beijing, Hangzhou, and the Buddhist caves at Dunhuang, in Gansu province. He found elements of folk art that he incorporated into his paintings.
Exaggeration, spatial fragmentation, and deliberate clumsiness yield a comic theatricality. While creating a kind of “archaic awkwardness,” or gu zhuo, that was a hallmark of literati painting, they also subvert the refinements of that genre, reflecting the displacement of the Chinese painting tradition in the modern world of Taiwan."

The character, which is better known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation ""Zen,"" refers to a meditative sect of Buddhism that claimed--and still claims--numerous adherents in both China and Japan. The text was composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The character is written in cursive, or running, script (""xingshu"") in a manner that the artist characterizes as ""splash script."" The artist created this calligraphic work by splashing very wet, black ink at the top of the album leaf and then, using a brush loaded with water, by inscribing the character within the main and largest portion of the splash, creating a work in which the character appears pale gray against the black splash. Smaller dots of ink radiate out from the main splash. This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes one seal of the artist, which identifies it as a work of Fung Ming Chip. The seal, which the artist himself carved, can be described as follows:

The landscapes reflect the so-called Orthodox style that became popular in China in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries among such followers of Dong Qichang (1555-1636) as the so-called Four Wang--i.e., Wang Shimin (1592-1680), Wang Jian (1598-1677), Wang Hui (1632-1717), and Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715); the Orthodox style came to prominence in Korea in the nineteenth century, particularly in the works of Hŏ Ryŏn (1809-1892) and his followers. Each of this screen's landscapes presents a large mountain massed either in the center or at one side of the composition; each landscape affords a view into the far distance, just as each has a body of water--a lake or a wide river--at the bottom of the composition. Most of the landscapes include mountain pavilions, and the last one--i.e., the landscape at the viewer's left--includes a village nestled at the base of the distant mountains. The landscapes are done mainly in ink though a few sport touches of light color. The last landscape is a winter scene, so that the snow-covered mountains are rendered very schematically, and the cloudy skies are darker than the pristine mountains.

The inscription, signature, and seals indicate that these paintings were done by Kim Chae-tŏk during the ninth lunar month of 1869. Though little documentation survives concerning his life, Kim Chae-tŏk is known to have lived in the nineteenth century. He is believed to have been a professional painter and likely was active in Kyŏngsang province, probably in Taegu or Andong. (In fact, Estate records suggest that Jerry Lee Musslewhite purchased this screen in Taegu, North Kyŏngsang province.) The style of these paintings is related to that of Kim Yong (born 1837), a well-known, nineteenth-century, Korean painter.

Differing from Japanese traditional practice, in which two screens are paired to form a set, Korean screens generally are conceived as individual, stand-alone works rather than as pairs. And, unlike Japanese screens, which generally have six panels, Korean screens may have six, eight, ten, or even twelve panels. Whereas most Japanese pairs of screens boast a single, unified composition that spreads the full width of both screens, Korean screens may have a single, unified composition or they may have a series of individual compositions, one on each panel. This screen has just six panels, with one discrete painting on each panel.

Jerry Lee Musslewhite, or the Korean dealer from whom he purchased it, had this screen remounted in Korea in the 1960s, so the mounting is new and clean and shows virtually no wear. Given that six is an unusual number of panels for a landscape screen and that the last scene is a winter scene, it is possible that the original screen might have had eight panels and that the screen's theme was landscapes of the four seasons, with two panels for each season. Since there are only six panels today and since the artist did not inscribe a title, we likely will never know the original number of panels or the exact subject (other than generic landscapes).

Here it might be noted that the Estate of Jerry Lee Musslewhite included four additional landscapes by Kim Chae-tŏk, each framed and presented as a discrete painting. The paintings are very similar in subject matter, style, and composition to those in this screen; even the seals are virtually identical. It is unknown whether or not there is any connection between those four individual paintings and this screen.

The several very slender stalks of bamboo rise from a small, grass-covered hillock in the lower right corner. The composition is organized around the one very tall and several short stalks of bamboo that are depicted in black ink and that are thus to be read as nearest the viewer; the tallest of those stalks rises through the composition on a slight diagonal and reaches almost to the upper left corner. Several additional stalks of bamboo, some tall, some short, are depicted in gray ink, indicating both that they are slightly farther away from the viewer and that they are partially obscured by heavy mist. All of the bamboo stalks, whether painted in vibrant black or pale gray ink, appear in the foreground plane; the composition does not recede into deep three-dimensional space, so no middle- or background elements are included. The leaves and stalks are well painted; in addition, the varying heights of the bamboo stalks and the varying tonalities of ink lend visual and aesthetic balance to the composition. The artist's two-column inscription and signature appear in the lower left portion of the painting; planned as an integral element of the composition, they fill an area that otherwise would have been blank, resulting in an unbalanced composition. The painting is not dated, but it is one of the artist's mature works and it reflects the influence of the Japanese Nanga style, indicating that it was painted at the end of the nineteenth or, more likely, during the first one-third of the twentieth century."
2194,Lee Chun-Yi (Li Junyi) 李君毅,"Ten Thousand Years, Ten Thousand Years of Sleep, One Hundred Million Scattered Pieces",https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/337101,male,Asian and Mediterranean Art,"Center scroll of a set of three hanging scrolls forming a triptych; ink on paper; with artist's signature reading ""Erlinglingjiu nian chun Li Junyi shi yu Meiguo Fenghuangcheng""","Green, Grey, Grey, Grey, Grey, Red",2009,21st century,Chinese,"This triptych comprises a set of three hanging scrolls, each painted in ink on paper. The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.

Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.

The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.

The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao)."

Set on stilts that elevate it above the waters, the thatched pavilion is situated between the river and a mountain down whose sides cascades a waterfall, its waters flowing under the pavilion and into the river. The scholar gazes toward the composition’s left edge, which is dominated by the river and the distant mountains, whose details are completely obscured by the intervening mists, which impart a light blue hue. The thatched pavilion appears at the bottom of the painting, in the center foreground. A series of tree-capped hillocks arcs from the composition’s lower right corner to the composition’s center, framing the multi-room pavilion. A tall peak with craggy, vertical sides and plateaus at its top dominates the right half of the composition. The waterfall tumbles down the front of the dominant peak, falling into an unseen stream that flows to the foreground, under the pavilion, and into the lake. The artist’s short, vertically oriented, four-character inscription reading ""Bi Ryu Kye Kak"" (Chinese, ""Fei Liu Xi Ge"") appears in the upper left corner of the painting; the inscription can be loosely translated as “Pavilion by a Waterfall and Stream.” The artist’s rectangular, red, relief seal reading ""So Ch’i"" (Chinese, ""Xiao Chi"") appears immediately to the (viewer’s) left of the inscription’s lower two characters.

The artist’s inscription/title, particularly the characters ""Bi Ryu"" (Chinese ""Fei Liu""), which Ho Ryon used to mean “waterfall,” suggests that the scene might well have been inspired by the Chinese poem “Gazing at the Waterfall on Mt. Lu” (Chinese ""Wang Lu Shan Pu Bu""), which was composed by the Tang-dynasty poet Li Bai (701-762):

Gazing at the Waterfall on Mt. Lu (Censer Mountain)
By Li Bai 

The mists enveloping Censer Mountain (Mt. Lu) shimmer violet in the sunshine.
The distant waterfall recalls a river hanging from the sky,
Its flying waters cascading straight down from three thousand feet up.
Is it the Milky Way tumbling from the highest heavens, star by star?


Despite its likely literary reference to a poem of Li Bai, the painting’s style derives from that of the Qing-dynasty Orthodox-school masters Wang Hui (1632-1717) and Wang Yuanqi (1642-1715). The portrayal of the scholar and of the thatched pavilion recalls the works of the Ming literati painter Shen Zhou (1427-1509).

He is said as a boy to have been deeply impressed by the work of a renowned fourteenth-century plum blossom painter, Wang Mian (1287-1359) and to have vowed to devote his life to mastering the subject painted by this master.  Not content with merely copying, Liu wandered the hills of his district studying plum trees to enrich his understanding of the subject.  In addition to his few extant paintings, his illustrated manual on ink-plum painting, Xuehu meipu, survives to represent his art.  Because it blooms in February, before donning its leaves, the Chinese plum (prunus mume) is associated with winter and is regarded as a symbol of strength in the face of adversity.  In addition, its blossoms symbolize feminine beauty and its weathered trunk the humble scholar.  

The artist's poem on this painting, inscribed in the upper left, reads:
A green dragon, it rears up high and seems to reach for the Milky Way
Like jade butterflies, in irregular patterns, unsoiled by mud.
Suddenly the Wind God Fengyi gives forth a wild whistle
And the splendor of spring is scattered all over, east and west.

He is said as a boy to have been deeply impressed by the work of a renowned fourteenth-century plum blossom painter, Wang Mian (1287-1359) and to have vowed to devote his life to mastering the subject painted by this master.  Not content with merely copying, Liu wandered the hills of his district studying plum trees to enrich his understanding of the subject.  In addition to his few extant paintings, his illustrated manual on ink-plum painting, Xuehu meipu, survives to represent his art.  Because it blooms in February, before donning its leaves, the Chinese plum (prunus mume) is associated with winter and is regarded as a symbol of strength in the face of adversity.  In addition, its blossoms symbolize feminine beauty and its weathered trunk the humble scholar.  

The artist's poem on this painting, inscribed in the upper left, reads:
A green dragon, it rears up high and seems to reach for the Milky Way
Like jade butterflies, in irregular patterns, unsoiled by mud.
Suddenly the Wind God Fengyi gives forth a wild whistle
And the splendor of spring is scattered all over, east and west.

Numerous bunches of ripe grapes hang from the vines. In the upper left corner of the painting one squirrel nibbles on a grape, while another squirrel in the lower right corner looks up toward the first.

The text is a forty-two-character poem composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The artist has stated to the curator that the work's title is Night (""Ye""). The character ""Ye"" appears in the fourth column from the left; in fact, it is the only character in that column of text. The characters are written in cursive, or running, script (""xingshu"") in a manner that the artist characterizes as ""section script."" This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes three seals of the artist, which identify it as a work of Fung Ming Chip. The three seals, which the artist himself carved, and their locations can be described as follows:

Left: Square, red, relief seal reading ""Ming Chip"" (Ming Qiu) [Artist's given name]
Center: Square, red, pictorial seal reading ""Yun"" (Clouds)
Right: Square, red, intaglio seal reading ""Jian Zhi Ji Li"" (Seeing this brings good fortune)

The poem can be translated as follows:

Freezing quiet streets
Whipping away,
Occasional passing cars.
Heartless street lights,
Faint north winds
Revive the underground dancer with a kiss.
Night
Deeply sunk within emptiness,
Happiness is actually
The color turquoise.

The characters are written in cursive, or running, script (""xingshu"") in a manner that the artist characterizes as ""rubbing script."" The artist created this calligraphic work by spreading a very wet wash of blue-gray-black ink over the paper, after which he inscribed the characters using a brush loaded with water, creating a work in which the characters appear pale grayish blue against a darker grayish blue ground.

The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.

Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.

The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.

The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao)."

The artist applies the gesso ground around the outer edges of the stretcher, so that the painted surface appears to be floating on a smooth white porcelain block. He applies color in thin layers of glaze, like so many veils. As many as 40 layers of glaze are built up over a period of several weeks. Laying down even, continuous brushstrokes in alternating layers of vertical and horizontal orientations, he creates a subtle grid pattern. The artist often applies one or more colors in addition to blue -- in this case, 6-8 layers of cinnabar green at different depths (traces of which can be seen around the edges of the painting). Layers of ultramarine in combination with royal blue (a mixture of ultramarine and titanium white) make the other colors vibrate, acting ""as a catalyst to bring the involved colors into spacious movement on the top of the surface."" (See artist's statement in object file.) The surface texture is purely the result of brushwork, which creates a structural discipline that interacts with the expansive dematerialized sensuality of blue.

In addition to being an enlightened statesman, Yi was an accomplished painter and calligrapher who was unsurpassed in his mastery of orchid painting. Frequently depicted in literati paintings alongside rocks and boulders, the orchid appears graceful, elegant, and unaffected by its rough surroundings. The orchids and rocks in Yi's paintings typically enter the composition at dramatic angles and generally occupy only one corner or one side of a composition. 

Korean folding screens often have six panels, like those painted in Japan; more characteristically, however, Korean screens boast eight, ten, or even twelve panels. In some cases, a Korean screen may feature a single, unified composition that spreads across all its panels; in other instances--such as this one--each panel is conceived as an individual painting. The ten separate paintings that compose this screen are grouped in four pairs, with an individual composition mounted on the first and last panels of the screen. Each of the four pairs in the middle can be read as a single composition or as two separate paintings. Such visual double entendres held a special allure for Korean literati artists of the nineteenth and early twentieth century. This screen's large size and its royal authorship indicate that it was painted for one of the royal palaces.

Each painting bears a personal seal of the artist, rather than a seal with the artist's name or sobriquet. For example, the seal in the lower right corner of the ninth panel (second from the left) translates into the aphorism ""The best time to view a flower is when it is half open."" The other nine personal seal impressions vary from idiomatic phrases to humorous remarks on Daoism and Buddhism. In the very last panel at the far left, however, Yi Ha-ŭng signs and impresses two of his artist's seals to the painting, making the authorship of this important screen indisputable. His inscription translates as, ""Done by the seventy-three-year-old old man Sŏk-p'a in the early autumn of 1892.""

The son of a portrait painter, Ren Yi learned to paint at a young age and in adulthood used his art as his livelihood. After living for a time in Ningbo and Suzhou, Ren finally settled in the newly developed port city of Shanghai in 1868. From his base in bustling Shanghai, Ren Yi developed a new and novel style of painting that won him a wide audience and made him the acknowledged leader of the Shanghai school, or Haipai. Though it favors light colors, Ren's style is at once bold, forceful, and vivid, as exemplified by this delightful bird-and-flower painting.

Depicting a small bird with outstretched wings darting through the attenuated stems of lotus growing in a pond, this painting adopts a perspective that brings the viewer down to the water's surface, virtually eye-to-eye with the tiny creature. The broad, blue-green lotus leaves and lush white blossoms appear enormous as they loom above the bird, while a thick forest of lotus stems nearly camouflages it altogether. Faint brush strokes representing water reeds and grasses delineate the pond's surface, which would otherwise appear as a void.

The lotus is an important motif in Chinese art that traces its symbolic origins to Buddhism. Because it grows in muddy waters, yet emerges upright, unsullied, fragrant, and beautiful, the lotus became an emblem of purity in Buddhist literature and imagery. The two Chinese terms for lotus--lian and he--are phonetically identical to numerous auspicious phrases, such as love and harmony, and are thus ubiquitous in Chinese folk art and rebuses.

A wide range of subjects--flowers, figures, animals, waves, and abstract designs--are depicted on the fans; a scene from the Ukifune chapter of the 'Tale of Genji' appears on one fan, for example, while another, at the screen's right edge, shows the moon rising over autumn grasses, the same subject that embellishes the covers of the lacquer boxes nearby.  The total effect is one of astonishing brilliance and visual appeal.
Painted by a Rimpa artist, this screen represents a type termed ""ogi nagashi byobu"" in Japanese, that is, ""a screen with floating fans.""  The type originated in the Muromachi period (1393-1602), when it soared in popularity.  Although the oldest extant floating-fan screen was painted in the sixteenth century, literary sources record its existence a hundred years earlier.The inspiration for the subject is said to be a tale in which a breeze whisked a fan from the hand of a person crossing the Tōgetsukyō Bridge at Arashiyama, in Kyoto, and dashed it into the river below; charmed by the sight of waves bearing a fan, passersby tossed their own fans into the river to enlarge the scene.The folding fan's lunette shape had long attracted the attention of painters, who found it a challenge to create a composition appropriate to the shape.  Although many earlier artists had decorated fans with attractive designs, Sōtatsu (active, late 16th-first half 17th century), the initiator of the Rimpa style, vitalized painting on fan-shaped surfaces by employing a wide array of subjects and by arranging them in witty compositions.  The fan shape subsequently became a favored format of Rimpa-school painters."

According to legend, one of the Mughal emperor Akbar’s (r. 1556-1605) musicians started a palace fire after being forced to perform this raga against his better judgment.

Her father was the artist Kusumi Morikage (c. 1620-1690) and her mother, Kuniko, was a niece of the painter Kano Tan'yū (1602-1674). Morikage was one of Tan'yū's most outstanding pupils. Yukinobu lived in Kyoto for most of her life and married another Tan'yū pupil named Kiyohara Hirano Morikiyo. That Yukinobu, her mother, and grandmother were all married to Tan'yū's pupils is evidence of the strong familial bonds characteristic of the Kano school. Yukinobu's thematic range was diverse. She was trained in the academic Chinese styles used for painting landscapes, figures, and birds and flowers.

Painted very much in the Chinese manner, this scroll presents peonies and a rock. The Chinese regard the tree peony, or mudan hua, as the ""king of flowers."" Indigenous to remote, mountainous areas of China, the plant was apparently first cultivated in the imperial gardens during the Sui dynasty (581-618). It gained popularity immediately and was considered the most prized of flowers by the Song dynasty (960-1279); by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644), the peony was also regarded as a symbol of wealth because of its numerous petals. Its fame in China ensured the peony's introduction into Korea and Japan, where it also enjoyed great popularity and auspicious symbolism.

The competing verses were sometimes accompanied by depictions of their authors. A tradition of painted poet ""portraits"" evolved in tandem with a taste for realism during the Kamakura period (1185-1333), although the images were based on imagined likenesses rather than on actual appearance.

This scroll satirizes those earlier literary and pictorial legacies by portraying the twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac (rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, rooster, dog, and boar) in the guise of traditional Japanese poets. Each wears a sumptuously rendered costume--the tiger, rabbit, and dragon in the robes of high-ranking male courtiers; the snake in the exquisite multilayered dress of a court lady. Each is seated against a gold-misted ground beneath an appropriate verse.

The heron faces the viewer and stands hunched forward with its left leg raised. His body mostly obscured by the heron, the crow stands in profile behind his companion, facing the viewer’s right, his heavy lid and furrowed brow lending it an air of slight menace. The tree trunk was painted perfunctorily with a dry brush; only sparse bits of leaves and short branches appear on the trunk’s lower portion. A signature and red intaglio seal appear at the right edge of the composition."

It depicts Mt. Emei's famous and very colorful sunrise. Diagonally set masses of rocks lead to the peak--presumably the Mt. Emei's summit--at the top center of the composition. Tall pines at the bottom center of the composition direct the viewer's eye to the summit and to the lone, simple house with orange walls and pale gray roof that sits atop the peak. The mountain slopes downward at the right, leaving open sky as well as space for the artist's inscription, signature, and seal. Because Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful sunrise, the artist has employed a warm orange as the painting's dominant color. The painting was mounted in Japan and thus boasts a traditional Japanese mounting with free-moving futai ornaments.

The artist, Dong Shouping (1904-1997), was born in Hongdong, Shanxi province, in 1904. He received a BA in economics from Eastern University, Beijing, in 1926, after which he began to paint by studying masterworks of traditional painting on display in the then newly established National Palace Museum, Beijing. By the early 1930s he had become well-known as a connoisseur of Chinese painting and as a professional painter of birds and flowers; at that time he began to hone his skills as a landscape painter. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45, i.e., World War II), Dong Shouping lived in Chengdu, Sichuan province; in order to broaden his skill as a landscape painter, he traveled as widely as circumstances permitted, taking in as many varied landscape types as he could. It was during these years that he came to know and love Mt. Emei. After both the Sino-Japanese and Chinese Civil wars had ended, Dong Shouping took up residence in Beijing. In 1953 he joined Rongbaozhai Art Publishing House, Beijing, as a specialist in woodblock printing; he worked there until 1965, where he retired. He served as honorary chairman of the Beijing Society for the Research of Traditional Chinese Paintings, and he was a member of the Chinese Artists' Association.

Mount Emei sits at the western rim of the Sichuan Basin; at 3,099 meters (10,167 ft), it is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains. The ""patron saint"" of Mt. Emei is the Buddhist Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, known in Chinese as Puxian Pu. Mt. Emei was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Mt. Emei enjoys a special reverence in the minds of traditional Chinese as it is the location of the first Buddhist temple built in China in the first century CE. The site boasts seventy-six Buddhist monasteries dating to the Ming and Qing periods, most of them located near the mountain's top. 
Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful spectacles, which include the sunrise and the Clouds Sea both of which are best seen from the mountain's Golden Summit and both of which have been considered famous natural wonders for centuries. The sunrise is varied, but optimally begins with the ground and sky being in the same dark purple, soon showing rosy clouds, followed by a bright purple arc and then a semicircle where the sun is coming up. The Clouds Sea includes several cloud phenomena, e.g. clouds appearing in the sky above, in addition to the regular clouds beneath.

An air of isolation, perhaps desolation, emerges from trees rendered with deliberate naïveté. The simple depictions of buildings convey honesty and integrity. The artist concludes her inscription with “Chu-tsing, my venerable brother, asked me to imitate the old style.”
The first part of the inscription, however, expresses the dilemma of combining tradition with experimentation: “Some think bringing forth new ideas is good; others think relying on the past is good. I sing a new melody, but use the old tone. Am I neither here nor there?”
Trained in Beijing by artists of the former Manchu court, Zeng mastered the classical tradition in both technique and spirit. After moving to Honolulu in 1949, she began to experiment with Western abstract painting and developed a distinctive modern style. This work, as the inscription indicates, is an attempt to capture the spirit of a traditional ink painting."

While welcoming accident and spontaneity, the artist carefully controlled his process.
Feng Zhongrui, who had moved from China to Taiwan in 1949, was active in the modernist movement led by members of the Fifth Moon Group. Together with Liu Guosong, he explored concepts of abstraction and nonobjective painting, taking inspiration in part from the American abstract expressionists and enlisting Chinese media in novel ways."

The expressive brushwork calls to mind the works of China’s seventeenth-century individualist painters, especially Shitao (also known as Daoji; 1642–1707). The artist did not sign this painting, but impressed his seal near the lower right corner.
The inscription on the painting is not by the artist, but by Rao Zongyi, a scholar. The inscription reads, “Emerald layers cover old trailing branches. The sky, with stars densely packed, is revealed. Chu-tsing asked Ximing to paint this.”
The artist, who received his training at the Shanghai Academy of Art, spent the war years in Sichuan province and later moved to Hong Kong, where he taught painting in an academic setting. Traditionally, it was common for a literati artist to paint a work for a friend and ask a fellow scholar-artist with expertise in poetry and calligraphy to inscribe it. Peng and his colleague Rao continued that tradition here."

The character, which is better known in the West by the Japanese pronunciation ""Zen,"" refers to a meditative sect of Buddhism that claimed--and still claims--numerous adherents in both China and Japan. The text was composed and inscribed on this album leaf by Fung Ming Chip (standard Mandarin transcription: Feng Mingqiu). The upper two thirds of this album leaf is blank except for the seal impressed at the very top; the lower one third includes several broad brushstrokes in black ink, the network of brushstrokes resembling two stacked Z's. Written upside down, as if reflected from above, the single character is written in cursive, or running, script (xingshu) in a manner that the artist characterizes as ""reflection script."" The artist created this calligraphic work by brushing the broad, black strokes and then, using a brush loaded with water, by inscribing the character within the upper portion of the net of brushstrokes, creating a work in which the character appears pale gray against the black strokes. The artist has stated that he intended to create a calligraphic work that resembles a pictorial, nighttime scene in which the moon--in this instance, the character chan--is reflected in a lake (i.e., the network of black brushstrokes at the bottom). This calligraphic work is not dated; however, the artist stated to the curator that he created it in 2009. This calligraphic work is not signed, but it includes one seal of the artist, which identifies it as a work of Fung Ming Chip.

The central scroll is a formal portrait of Mao Zedong (1893–1976); the flanking scrolls represent landscapes. The Mao portrait is based both on the official portrait photograph of Mao Zedong that was taken in 1959 by Xinhua News Agency photojournalists Meng Qingbiao (1925–1969) and Ho Bo (born 1924) and on the official portrait painting of Chairman Mao that that was created in 1959 by Zhang Zhenshi (1914–1992), a professor at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts, Beijing, based on the official portrait photograph. The portrait presents a bust-length, frontal portrait of Chairman Mao, his head and shoulders turned slightly, almost imperceptibly, to his proper right. His hair is combed straight back, his eyes are fully open, and his mouth suggests a slight smile. He wears a Mao jacket, buttoned all the way to the top; one circular button appears in the inverted “V” formed by the two downward-projecting points of the collar. Perhaps part of the Mao-jacket collar, perhaps the top of a collar of a shirt worn under the jacket, a slender white line encircles Chairman Mao’s neck, readily distinguishing garment from flesh. A circular black disc appears in the center of the otherwise unembellished white paper above Chairman Mao’s head. The background area of the portrait—but not the area above the portrait—are fully textured, so that the image of Chairman Mao emerges from a gray background. The characters that appear throughout the painting, both in the portrait of Chairman Mao and in the disc above—i.e., one character within each square of the grid—read Mao Ze Dong; arranged in random order, they also appear in random orientations, some right side up, others upside down, and yet others sideways. The “texturing characters” appear in the image of Mao, in the background areas, and in the disc above but are most evident in the background areas and in the disc. A long inscription comprising 180 characters appears in the rectangular border surrounding the painting. A narrow strip of unembellished white paper appears just inside the border, clearly differentiating border from portrait.

Each landscape scroll presents a view into a deep mountain valley that recedes distantly into the pictorial space. Each landscape is a bilaterally symmetrical rendition of the other, so that the landscapes are mirror images of each other. Appearing black and positioned at the “inside edge” of each landscape composition—i.e., on the side of the composition opposite from the blank grid square that is an “implied seal” (see description below)—a towering foreground peak partially blocks the view of the mountain range that rises on one side of the valley. Silhouetted against the receding valley, old pines grow around the periphery of the foreground peak and around the top of the shorter peak that accompanies it. When the landscape scrolls are hung on either side of the central scroll, the dark, foreground peaks frame the Mao portrait. A rectangular area of blank paper appears above each landscape, and a dark border frames each composition and the accompanying blank paper above, a narrow strip of unembellished white paper separating border from landscape, the arrangement echoing that of the central, portrait scroll.

The artist did the “original version” of this triptych in 1988 in fulfillment of requirements for his bachelor of arts degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The artist sold the Mao portrait from that set to Kingsley Liu, a Hong Kong collector of contemporary Chinese ink paintings; the artist still owns the two landscapes from the original set. The artist originally was thinking of simply painting a new Mao portrait, which he would pair with the existing, original landscape paintings (from 1988) for this set (which was commissioned twenty years after the original set; however, upon re-examining the landscape scrolls, which had been stored in Hong Kong, the artist discovered that they sustained water damaged while stored. Thus, the artist created an entirely new set in 2009.

The artist has stated that although this work is a triptych and although he would prefer that the scrolls be exhibited as a set, in fact, the scrolls may be exhibited in whichever arrangement or grouping that curators would like; thus, the scrolls may be shown individually, just as the two landscape scrolls may be exhibited as a pair (without the central portrait of Mao).

Although European fashions had entered Persian clothing and furniture by the middle of the nineteenth century, this figure’s garments and posture are staunchly traditional. He wears the tall Astrakhan hat favored by the Qajar court and two long robes. The outer cloak is broadly sketched in, but the blue inner robe is carefully rendered in a moiré pattern. The details of the striped sash and the complicated piping on the robes suggest the fine woolen fabrics woven in Kirman, which Qajar government policy aimed to promote over Kashmir imports at the time this painting was created. The sitter’s two hands—with henna-stained nails—are tucked into his sash, along with two rolled documents."

(A magnificent screen by Prince Yi Ha-ŭng is featured in this gallery's glass-fronted screen case.) A professor of painting and calligraphy at the Institute of Arts in Seoul, Kim was also one of the founders of the Painting and Calligraphy Association, established in 1918. 

The orchid, a symbol of loyalty and personal integrity, held a fascination for literati painters, since its grasslike leaves and delicate, simple flowers lent themselves to depiction with calligraphic brushwork. Chinese artists had begun to paint the orchid during the Song dynasty (960-1279), the subject becoming ever more popular in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. By the eighteenth century, the taste for paintings of orchids had spread to Korea, where these works enjoyed considerable vogue in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. 

Chinese and Korean artists typically paired orchids and rocks, the orchids coaxing the artist to employ his most delicate, curvilinear brushwork, the rocks tempting him to present his most forceful and expressionistic brushwork. The inscription on this painting translates as:

While sitting quietly, I sense a subtle fragrance.
Such subtlety exists only between reality and imagination.

Her right arm stretches outward behind her, allowing the fabric of her sleeve to fall open and reveal its designs, but her right hand remains concealed. Written in cursive script, the character for warbler (uguisu) appears among the plum blossoms on the sleeve.

Skilled at landscape depictions but best known for his representations of oxen, Kim Sik came from a prominent family of painters and was the grandnephew of Kim Che (active 1540), one of sixteenth-century Korea's most famous painters of birds and flowers. The genre of bird-and-flower painting arose in China during the Northern Song period (960-1127) and remained popular through succeeding dynasties; it spread to Korea early in the Chosŏn (1392-1911) dynasty and to Japan in the Muromachi period (1392-1568). Chinese painters tended to depict birds in color, while Korean and Japanese artists preferred to render them in monochrome ink. The hard-edged washes used to portray the birds and rose leaves, in this leaf attests to Kim Sik's mastery of brush and ink. Native to China, roses appear only occasionally in Chinese paintings; by contrast, they occur with some frequency in Korean and Japanese works. Gold-flecked paper enjoyed a measure of popularity among Chinese literati artists of the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) periods; it sparked interest among Korean painters of the mid-Chosŏn period and claimed widespread popularity by the nineteenth century. Although they had employed a variety of decorated papers at least since Heian times (794-1185), Japanese artists seldom used this type of lightly flecked paper. Only occasionally used by Chinese painters, tinted papers enjoyed a vogue in Korea throughout the Chosŏn dynasty. Such colored papers seldom were dyed during manufacture; rather, they were tinted with ink washes--generally pale gray or blue--after manufacture but before painting."

Her right arm stretches outward behind her, allowing the fabric of her sleeve to fall open and reveal its designs, but her right hand remains concealed. Written in cursive script, the character for warbler (uguisu) appears among the plum blossoms on the sleeve.

Skilled at landscape depictions but best known for his representations of oxen, Kim Sik came from a prominent family of painters and was the grandnephew of Kim Che (active 1540), one of sixteenth-century Korea's most famous painters of birds and flowers. The genre of bird-and-flower painting arose in China during the Northern Song period (960-1127) and remained popular through succeeding dynasties; it spread to Korea early in the Chosŏn (1392-1911) dynasty and to Japan in the Muromachi period (1392-1568). Chinese painters tended to depict birds in color, while Korean and Japanese artists preferred to render them in monochrome ink. The hard-edged washes used to portray the birds and rose leaves, in this leaf attests to Kim Sik's mastery of brush and ink. Native to China, roses appear only occasionally in Chinese paintings; by contrast, they occur with some frequency in Korean and Japanese works. Gold-flecked paper enjoyed a measure of popularity among Chinese literati artists of the late Ming (1368-1644) and early Qing (1644-1911) periods; it sparked interest among Korean painters of the mid-Chosŏn period and claimed widespread popularity by the nineteenth century. Although they had employed a variety of decorated papers at least since Heian times (794-1185), Japanese artists seldom used this type of lightly flecked paper. Only occasionally used by Chinese painters, tinted papers enjoyed a vogue in Korea throughout the Chosŏn dynasty. Such colored papers seldom were dyed during manufacture; rather, they were tinted with ink washes--generally pale gray or blue--after manufacture but before painting."

5053,Kano Yūsen,Sparrows on a Branch of Nandina in Winter,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/211962,male,Asian and Mediterranean Art,"Hanging scroll; ink and color on paper; with signature reading ""Yusen Hogen""","Brown, Yellow, Brown, Brown, Green",late 18th-early 19th century,18th-19th century,Japanese,"Executed in ink, color, and white pigment on silk, this charming painting in hanging scroll format presents a winter scene of a nandina bush with three sparrows perched upon the plant’s snow-laden branches. From the lower left corner of the composition, the woody stalks of nandina reach upwards, culminating in clusters of leave reddish orange berries that appear from afar to be covered in snow, as large unpainted areas of reserved light silk surround the foliage. A pair of sparrows sits huddled together on the bush’s lower branches; they glance upward toward a single sparrow, who rests upon an upper branch and returns their gaze. An ink wash was applied to the silk to carefully darken background areas of the picture field and suggest dark clouds on a snowy day. Splashes of white pigment, representing falling snow flakes, further embellish the winter scene. A signature and red square intaglio seal appear at the lower left, just to the right of the nandina stalks emerging from the ground."

Two of his four hands holds paper with black inscriptions. Based on the text associated with the image, Brahma is most likely holding the Vedas in hands. Another hand holds a large gold ladle and the fourth gestures in conversation. He faces a kneeling female mendicant who provides a fire offering to the God. The female devotee wears a chaniya choli, consisting of a pink crop top and a long blue and red skirt. A translucent shawl covers her head and runs down her body. She is also adorned with jewelry, consisting of a heard ornament, a pendant necklace, strands of pearls, armlets, bracelets, earrings, and a nose ring. Her hands are raised in veneration. Behind her is a standing female attendant who holds a white scarf over the mendicant’s head, denoting the latter’s royal status. The attendant wears a chaniya choli consisting of a yellow crop top and green skirt; a shawl that covers her head and runs down her back; earrings; nose ring; armlets; and bracelets. In the background is a large white pavilion flanked by tall green trees. Male peacocks perch on some of these trees. The blue sky bears wispy clouds and a gold sun with a smiling face. "

5831,Pu Ru (Pu Xinyu) 溥儒 (溥心畬),Landscape with Two Mountain Pavilions,https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/315498,unknown,Asian and Mediterranean Art,"Album leaf; ink and colors on paper; with signature reading ""Xishan Yishi Pu Ru""; with three seals of the artist","Brown, Green, Yellow, Grey, Grey, Grey",probably second quarter of the 20th century,20th century,Chinese,"This album leaf was painted by Pu Ru (1896-1963), a member of the Qing imperial family and a cousin of the last emperor. Known for his exceptionally elegant paintings in classical style, Pu Ru was one of the most famous and most talented poets, painters, and calligraphers of the first half of the twentieth century. Painted in ink and colors on paper, this large, square album leaf represents a landscape with two mountain pavilions. A narrow body of water--likely a lake or river-- stretches across the bottom of the composition, its edge bordered by several rocky outcroppings that recede diagonally into the composition. Appearing just to the right of the composition's center, several majestic pines grow from these rocks. Seen through the pines and partially obscured by them, two mountain pavilions rise in the middleground, probably from hills just beyond the foreground rocks. Four deciduous trees in full leaf grow from rocks at the left of the composition. A tall, round-topped mountain dominates the right side of the composition, and a triangular mountain towers in the background, its details obscured by mist. The artist's inscription and signature appear at the top center of the painting in eight columns of calligraphy that read from right to left; one seal of the artist appears at the beginning of the inscription and another just to the left of the signature (i.e., the last column of calligraphy). Except for the reddish browns used for the mountain pavilions, the artist has restricted the painting's palette to cool blues and greens.

Pu Ru (1896-1963), courtesy name Xinyu, was a native of Beijing and a member of the Manchu imperial family. He was cousin of the last Emperor Henry Pu Yi and was one of the children of the imperial family who was presented at the palace as a candidate to be considered as a possible future emperor. After the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, Pu Ru generally used his hao, or sobriquet, Pu Xinyu. He studied at Berlin University, majoring in astronomy and biology. After returning from Europe, he retreated into the Western Mountains (of Beijing), where he spent many years at the Jietai Monastery to develop his painting skills. He was strongly against Pu Yi's (his cousin's) cooperation with Japan. Pu Xinyu's retreat to the Western Mountains explains the sobriquet that he used in the signature on this painting:  ""Xishan Yishi Pu Ru"" which means ""Hermit of the Western Mountains, Pu Ru."" 

Pu Ru was a well-known teacher of poetry, painting, and calligraphy, first on the Chinese mainland and then on Taiwan, where he retreated in 1949, along with the Nationalist government. He received students, but the teacher-student relationship was very much in the classical sense, almost a parent-child relationship, in which the teacher, like the father, carried the responsibility of the well-being, character-building and spiritual development of the child. Therefore before he accepted a student, Pu Ru carefully examined the student's character and family background.

His training was highly disciplinary. He demanded that his students prepare their own ink using traditional inksticks and inkstones, for such preparation brought peace and equanimity to the mind, qualities that would assist the painter in connecting himself to the spirit of art and creativity or to the sphere of beauty and grace. In the entire first year of training with Pu Xinyu, the student was not allowed to paint, but to practice calligraphy only. In the entire second year, he was to draw rocks, mountains and branches of trees. In the third year, he was allowed to cover the trees and branches with leaves, and so on. This kind of schooling builds up the total command of the brush as well as humility and strength. Every Saturday morning, his students would gather around him to receive a lesson in Chinese literature, after which their works were presented to the master and new assignments were given. In these Saturday mornings classes, Master Pu never just talked; he was always doing something else at the same time, either calligraphy, painting, or playing a moon-sitar (a string instrument), many times with his precious white face long-armed monkey clinging to his chest. He was often amused by what he was painting and liked to make fun of the figures which he created.

5832,Dong Shouping 董壽平,Colors of Mount Emei (Emeishan se),https://www.harvardartmuseums.org/collections/object/315532,unknown,Asian and Mediterranean Art,"Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper; with signature reading ""Dong Shouping"" and artist's seal reading ""Shou Ping""","Orange, Brown, Brown, Brown, Grey, Grey",mid-20th century,20th century,Chinese,"Dong Shouping (1904-1997) painted this short hanging scroll in ink and colors on paper. It depicts Mt. Emei's famous and very colorful sunrise. A mass of rocks--presumably the mountain's summit--occupies the left half, and more, of the painting, its diagonally set ridges alternating with valleys. The waterfall that emerges from a valley in the painting's lower left corner disappears into the mist at the bottom of the painting. Pines cluster around the lone, simple house that is perched at the right edge of the mountain mass. Their details obscured by mist, distant peaks occupy the right portion of the composition. The uppermost portion of the painting is blank, suggesting the sky. Because Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful sunrise, the artist has employed a warm orange as the painting's dominant color. The painting was mounted in Japan and thus boasts a traditional Japanese mounting with free-moving futai ornaments. This painting is not dated by inscription; we have dated it to c. 1961 on the basis of its stylistic similarity to the other Lin-bequest painting by Dong Shouping--which also represents Mt. Emei and also shows warm orange tones--which is dated by inscription to 1961. 

The artist, Dong Shouping (1904-1997), was born in Hongdong, Shanxi province, in 1904. He received a BA in economics from Eastern University, Beijing, in 1926, after which he began to paint by studying masterworks of traditional painting on the then newly established National Palace Museum, Beijing. By 1931 he had become well-known as a connoisseur of Chinese painting and as a professional painter of birds and flowers; at that time he began to hone his skills as a landscape painter. During the Sino-Japanese War (1937-45, i.e., World War II), Dong Shouping lived in Chengdu, Sichuan province; in order to broaden his skill as a landscape painter, he traveled as widely as circumstances permitted, taking in as many varied landscape types as he could. It was during these years that he came to know and love Mt. Emei. After both the Sino-Japanese and Chinese Civil wars had ended, Dong Shouping took up residence in Beijing. In 1953 he joined Rongbaozhai Art Publishing House, Beijing, as a specialist in woodblock printing; he worked there until 1965, where he retired. He served as honorary chairman of the Beijing Society for the Research of Traditional Chinese Paintings, and he was a member of the Chinese Artists' Association.

Mt Emei sits at the western rim of the Sichuan Basin; at 3,099 meters (10,167 ft), it is the highest of China's Four Sacred Buddhist Mountains. The ""patron saint"" of Mt. Emei is the Buddhist Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, known in Chinese as Puxian Pu. Mt. Emei was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Mt. Emei enjoys a special reverence in the minds of traditional Chinese as it is the location of the first Buddhist temple built in China in the first century CE. The site boasts seventy-six Buddhist monasteries dating to the Ming and Qing periods, most of them located near the mountain's top. 
Mt. Emei is famous for its colorful spectacles, which include the sunrise and the Clouds Sea both of which are best seen from the mountain's Golden Summit and both of which have been considered famous natural wonders for centuries. The sunrise is varied, but optimally begins with the ground and sky being in the same dark purple, soon showing rosy clouds, followed by a bright purple arc and then a semicircle where the sun is coming up. The Clouds Sea includes several cloud phenomena, e.g. clouds appearing in the sky above, in addition to the regular clouds beneath.

One boy sits astride the ox's back while the other, who stands in the center of the composition, pulls on a rope attached to the ox's nose, trying valiantly to induce the stubborn ox to step out of the stream and onto dry land. The two old, gnarled willow trees that grow on the far bank of the river dominate the left half of the composition and frame a dwelling that must lie beyond the picket fence. The artist's inscription, signature, and seals appear in the upper right portion of the painting.

The theme of herdboys and oxen first became popular in China during the Southern Song period (1127-1279). When it first appeared, it had Zen overtones. While not a major theme of Chinese painting, the subject continued to enjoy some limited popularity in the succeeding Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. The Harvard Art Museum collection includes one painting on this theme (1923.146), an album leaf from the Ming dynasty representing one boy on the back of a water buffalo, and one small Ming-dynasty jade (1942.185.122), a paperweight in gray nephrite representing one boy on the back of a recumbent water buffalo.

We have not yet found the artist, Lü Yao, mentioned in any literature on the history of Chinese painting. Although we at first thought the painting might date to the eighteenth century, we now believe that it likely was done in Shanghai in the nineteenth century by an artist of the so-called Shanghai school. In the nineteenth century, the bingchen cyclical year corresponds to 1856.

In the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries, the bingchen cyclical year corresponds to 1736, 1796, 1856, and 1916. The painting has to have been done in one of those years.

The surroundings—highly abstracted trees below and loosely defined peaks and a waterfall in the distance—heighten the suggestion of a small paradise, impossibly remote and elusive.
The artist inscribed the painting, “Asking my brother Chu-tsing, the expert, for his comment. Painted in Forest Hills, New York, North America, in the 74th year of the Republic, during the early spring of the jiazi year [1984]. A traveling native of Taojiang, Hu Nianzu.”
In 1948 Hu left mainland China—Taojiang in Hunan province was his family home—for Taiwan. There he studied with Huang Junbi (1898–1991) at National Taiwan Normal University. He spent many years in New York State before returning to Taiwan, where he resides today. This painting reflects the strong influence of Huang Junbi."

The text is written in a combination of Chinese characters, or ""kanji"", and native Japanese script, or ""hiragana"". Inscribed by Takabatake Shikibu (1785-1881), the poem is written in script that alternates between cursive, or running, script (Chinese, ""xingshu"") and draft script (Chinese, ""caoshu""). Though not dated, this calligraphic work bears a signature of the artist in the lower right corner--i.e., the second column of text from the right is the artist's signature. The poem is inscribed on an album leaf of a type known in Japanese as a ""shikishi"", or poem card. At some point the ""shikishi"" album leaf was mounted as a hanging scroll, the form in which it appears today. In the present mounting, the album leaf appears just below the center of a long stretch of buff mounting paper, which is bordered top and bottom by a strip of white mounting silk with brocaded designs woven in gold; above and below the gold-on-white strips and along the sides of the buff paper is dark green mounting silk subtly embellished with a woven pattern; at the top and bottom of the scroll appear longer sections of plain, medium brown mounting silk, the slightly longer top section articulated with affixed (i.e., mounted in place) ""futai"" streamers."

Although rocks, trees, and mountains dominate the scene, tiny figures appear throughout the landscape, crossing bridges, inhabiting village dwellings, and fishing from small boats.  At the end of the scroll, the painting is dated and signed by the artist Wen Zhengming (1470-1559), an important literati painter from Suzhou and a leading figure of the Wu School. A colophon by the Qing scholar Weng Tonghe (1830-1904) follows the painting and comments on the artist's great skill in capturing the essence of past masters while still exhibiting his individualistic style and the meticulous brushwork for which Wen Zhengming was renowned. (A notable Chinese statesman who served as Prime Minister of China, Weng Tonghe was not only a collector and connoisseur but Wan-go H.C. Weng's great-great-grandfather. The colophon and seal indicate that Weng Tonghe collected this scroll, likely in the mid- to late nineteenth century. The scroll, along with the entire collection, remained in the Weng Family through succeeding generations, until the collection was inherited by the infant Wan-go H.C. Weng in 1919.)"

The valley at the bottom runs from the center of the painting and off to the right, disappearing around a cliff. The precipitous walls of the gorge, captured in black ink with a small amount of color, are enshrouded in small clusters of clouds, sunlight barely permeating the darkness. A cluster of pine trees stands on a rocky outcropping in the foreground on the left, and another grove is visible at the top of the mountain in the center. The artist’s name and seal have been added at the lower right of the painting."
